## Memory Vue Project

Welcome to the memory-vue project!

In this project, we will develop a memory game where the objective is to find two matching cards among various face-down cards. We will utilize modern technologies and popular tools to create an interactive and engaging user experience.

### Tools Used

We will be using the following tools to develop the project:

- **Vue 3:** A popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A fast and lightweight development environment for Vue applications.
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- **Husky and Commitlint:** Tools to enhance commit quality and enforce clear and consistent commit message conventions.
- **Vitest:** A testing framework for Vue applications.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that will help us style our game efficiently.
- **NVM (Node Version Manager):** A tool to manage and switch Node.js versions easily.
- **Sass:** A powerful CSS preprocessor that will enable us to write more maintainable and structured styles.
- **Stylelint and Prettier:** Tools to maintain clean and consistent CSS code.

### Instructions to Set Up the Project

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can install it using NVM to ensure you have the correct version.
   ```
   nvm install
   nvm use
   ```

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ocralo/memory-vue.git
   cd memory-vue
   ```

3. Install project dependencies.
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Instructions to Run the Project

Once you have set up the project, you can run it locally to see the memory game in action.

1. Run the following command to start the development server with Vite.
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and visit the URL provided by Vite to see the live memory game.

### Instructions for Running Tests

To ensure that our game functions correctly and to maintain code quality, we have implemented tests.

1. Run the following command to execute the tests with Vitest.
   ```
   npm run test
   ```

### Deploy and Continuous Integration

We use Firebase Hosting for deploying the application and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

- For each pull request created, GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys a preview version of the application to a staging environment. You can access the preview version using the provided link in the pull request.

- When changes are merged into the main branch, GitHub Actions will automatically deploy the latest version of the application to Firebase Hosting, making it live and accessible to users.

**URL to access the deployed application:** [https://memory-vue.web.app/](https://memory-vue.web.app/)
